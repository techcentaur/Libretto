. All around me are familiar faces. Worn out places, worn out faces. Bright and early for their daily races. Going nowhere, going nowhere. Their tears are filling up their glasses. No expression, no expression. Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow. No tomorrow, no tomorrow. And I find it kinda funny. I find it kinda sad. The dreams in which I am dying. Are the best I have ever had. I find it hard to tell you. I find it hard to take. When people run in circles. It is a very, very mad world, mad world. Children waiting for the day they feel good. Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday. And I feel the way that every child should. Sit and listen, sit and listen. Went to school and I was very nervous. No one knew me, no one knew me. Hello teacher tell me what is my lesson. Look right through me, look right through me. And I find it kinda funny. I find it kinda sad. The dreams in which I am dying. Are the best I have ever had. I find it hard to tell you. I find it hard to take. When people run in circles. It is a very, very mad world, mad world. Enlarging your world. Mad world. 
. When the day is long. And the night, the night is yours alone. When you are sure you have had enough. Of this life, well hang on. Do not let yourself go. Because everybody cries. And everybody hurts sometimes. Sometimes everything is wrong. Now it is time to sing along. When your day is night alone (Hold on, hold on). If you feel like letting go (Hold on). If you think you have had too much. Of this life, well hang on. Because everybody hurts. Take comfort in your friends. Everybody hurts. Do not throw your hand, oh no. Do not throw your hand. If you feel like you are alone. No, no, no, you are not alone. If you are on your own in this life. The days and nights are long. When you think you have had too much of this life to hang on. Well, everybody hurts sometimes. Everybody cries. And everybody hurts sometimes. And everybody hurts sometimes. So hold on, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Everybody hurts. No, no, no, no you are not alone. 
. I heard that you are settled down. That you found a girl and you are married now.. I heard that your dreams came true.. Guess she gave you things I did not give to you.. Old friend, why are you so shy?. Ai not like you to hold back or hide from the light.. I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited. But I could not stay away, I could not fight it.. I had hoped you would see my face and that you would be reminded. That for me it is not over.. Never mind, I will find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you too. Do not forget me, I beg. I will remember you said,. "Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,. Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead". You know how the time flies. Only yesterday was the time of our lives. We were born and raised. In a summer haze. Bound by the surprise of our glory days. I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited. But I could not stay away, I could not fight it.. I would hoped you would see my face and that you would be reminded. That for me it is not over.. Never mind, I will find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you too. Do not forget me, I beg. I will remember you said,. "Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.". Nothing compares. No worries or cares. Regrets and mistakes. They are memories made.. Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?. Never mind, I will find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you. Do not forget me, I beg. I will remember you said,. "Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead".. Never mind, I will find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you too. Do not forget me, I beg. I will remember you said,. "Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead,. Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead.". 
. It is been seven hours and fifteen days. Since you took your love away. I go out every night and sleep all day. Since you took your love away. Since you have been gone I can do whatever I want. I can see whomever I choose. I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant. But nothing. I said nothing can take away these blues. Because nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. It is been so lonely without you here. Like a bird without a song. Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling. Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong. I could put my arms around every boy I see. But they would only remind me of you. I went to the doctor and guess what he told me?. Guess what he told me?. He said, "Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,". But he is a fool. Because nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. All the flowers that you planted, mother, in the back yard. All died when you went away. I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard. But I am willing to give it another try. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. Nothing compares. Nothing compares to you. 
. I hurt myself today. To see if I still feel. I focus on the pain. The only thing that is real. The needle tears a hole. The old familiar sting. Try to kill it all away. But I remember everything. What have I become. My sweetest friend. Everyone I know goes away. In the end. And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt. I wear this crown of thorns. Upon my liar is chair. Full of broken thoughts. I cannot repair. Beneath the stains of time. The feelings disappear. You are someone else. I am still right here. What have I become. My sweetest friend. Everyone I know goes away. In the end. And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt. If I could start again. A million miles away. I would keep myself. I would find a way. 
. Well you only need the light when it is burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you have been high when you are feeling low. Only hate the road when you are missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. Staring at the bottom of your glass. Hoping one day you will make a dream last. But dreams come slow and they go so fast. You see her when you close your eyes. Maybe one day you will understand why. Everything you touch surely dies. But you only need the light when it is burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you have been high when you are feeling low. Only hate the road when you are missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. Staring at the ceiling in the dark. Same old empty feeling in your heart. Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast. Well you see her when you fall asleep. But never to touch and never to keep. Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep. Well you only need the light when it is burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you have been high when you are feeling low. Only hate the road when you are missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. Ohhh, oh no. And you let her go. Ohhh, oh no. Well you let her go. Cause you only need the light when it is burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you have been high when you are feeling low. Only hate the road when you are missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. Cause you only need the light when it is burning low. Only miss the sun when it starts to snow. Only know you love her when you let her go. Only know you have been high when you are feeling low. Only hate the road when you are missing home. Only know you love her when you let her go. And you let her go. 
. They made up their minds 
. And they started packing 
. They left before the sun came up that day 
. An exit to eternal summer slacking 
. But where were they going without ever 
. Knowing the way? . 
. They drank up the wine 
. And they got to talking 
. They now had more important things to say 
. And when the car broke down they started walking 
. Where were they going without ever 
. Knowing the way? . 
. Anyone can see the road that they walk on 
. Is paved in gold 
. And it is always summer 
. They will never get cold 
. They will never get hungry 
. They will never get old and grey 
. You can see their shadows wandering off somewhere 
. They wo not make it home 
. But they really do not care 
. They wanted the highway 
. They are happier there today, today . 
. Their children woke up 
. And they could not find them 
. They left before the sun came up that day 
. They just drove off and left it all behind 'em 
. But where were they going without ever 
. Knowing the way? . . 
. Sometimes I feel. Like I do not have a partner. Sometimes I feel. Like my only friend. Is the city I live in. The city of angels. Lonely as I am. Together we cry. I drive on her streets. Because she is my companion. I walk through her hills. Because she knows who I am. She sees my good deeds. And she kisses me windy. I never worry. Now that is a lie. I do not ever wanna feel. Like I did that day. But take me to the place I love. Take me all the way. I do not ever wanna feel. Like I did that day. But take me to the place I love. Take me all the way. It is hard to believe. That there is nobody out there. It is hard to believe. That I am all alone. At least I have her love. The city she loves me. Lonely as I am. Together we cry. I do not ever wanna feel. Like I did that day. But take me to the place I love. Take me all the way. I do not ever wanna feel. Like I did that day. But take me to the place I love. Take me all the way. Under the bridge downtown. Is where I drew some blood. Under the bridge downtown. I could not get enough. Under the bridge downtown. Forgot about my love. Under the bridge downtown. I gave my life away. 
. When you were here before. Could not look you in the eye. You are just like an angel. Your skin makes me cry. You float like a feather. In a beautiful world. I wish I was special. You are so fucking special. But I am a creep. I am a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I do not belong here. I do not care if it hurts. I want to have control. I want a perfect body. I want a perfect soul. I want you to notice. When I am not around. You are so fucking special. I wish I was special. But I am a creep. I am a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I do not belong here. Oh, oh. She is running out again. She is running out. She run run run run. Run. Whatever makes you happy. Whatever you want. You are so fucking special. I wish I was special. But I am a creep. I am a weirdo. What the hell am I doing here?. I do not belong here. I do not belong here. 
. I do not want to understand this horror
. There is a weight in your eyes
. I ca not admit
. Everybody ends up here in bottles
. But the name tag is the last thing you wanted. 
. As the world explodes
. We fall out of it
. And we ca not let go
. Because this will not go away
. There is a house built out in space. 
. I ca not see that thief
. That lives inside of your head
. But I can be some courage at
. The side of you bed
. I do not know what is happening
. And I ca not pretend
. But I can be your, be your. 
. Someone help us understand
. Who ordered this disgusting
. Arrangement, time and the end
. I do not want to hear who walked
. On water, because the hallways are empty
. And the clocks tick. 
. As the world implodes
. We fall into it
. And we ca not go home
. Because this will not go away
. There is a house built out in space. 
. I ca not see that thief
. That lives inside of your head
. But I can be some courage at
. The side of you bed
. I do not know what is happening
. And I ca not pretend. 
. It is a long, long get away
. It is a long, long get away
. Make it home again
. Make it home again
. It is a long, long get away
. It is a long, long get away. 
. I ca not see that thief
. That lives inside of your head
. But I can be some courage at
. The side of you bed

. The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.. It is strange what desire will make foolish people do.. I never dreamed that I would meet somebody like you.. And I never dreamed that I would lose somebody like you.. No, I do not want to fall in love (this girl is only gonna break your heart). No, I do not want to fall in love (this girl is only gonna break your heart). With you, with you (this girl is only gonna break your heart). What a wicked game you play to make me feel this way..

. Hey... oooh.... Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay. Were laid spread out before me as her body once did.. All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun. Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn. Ooh, and all I taught her was everything. Ooh, I know she gave me all that she wore. And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds of what was everything.. Oh, the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything.... I take a walk outside, I am surrounded by some kids at play. I can feel their laughter, so why do I sear?. Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head, I am spinning, oh,. I am spinning, how quick the sun can drop away. And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass of what was everything. All the pictures have all been washed in black, tattooed everything.... All the love gone bad turned my world to black. Tattooed all I see, all that I am, all I will be... yeah.... Uh huh... uh huh... ooh.... I know someday you will have a beautiful life,. I know you will be a star in somebody else is sky,. But why, why, why ca not it be, ca not it be mine?. Aah... uuh... Too doo doo too, too doo doo . 
. Mama, take this badge off of me. I ca not use it anymore. It is gettin' dark, too dark to see. I feel I am knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. Mama, put my guns in the ground. I ca not shoot them anymore. That long black cloud is comin' down. I feel I am knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven is door. 
. Would you know my name. If I saw you in heaven?. Would it be the same. If I saw you in heaven?. I must be strong. And carry on. Because I know I do not belong. Here in heaven. Would you hold my hand. If I saw you in heaven?. Would you help me stand. If I saw you in heaven?. I will find my way. Through night and day. Because I know I just ca not stay. Here in heaven. Time can bring you down. Time can bend your knees. Time can break your heart. Have you begging please, begging please. Beyond the door. There is peace I am sure. And I know there will be no more. Tears in heaven. Would you know my name. If I saw you in heaven?. Would you be the same. If I saw you in heaven?. I must be strong. And carry on. Because I know I do not belong. Here in heaven. Because I know I do not belong. Here in heaven. 
. Ben, the two of us need look no more
. We both found what we were looking for
. With a friend to call my own
. I will never be alone
. And you my friend will see
. You have got a friend in me
. (You have got a friend in me) . 
. Ben, you are always running here and there
. (Here and there) 
. You feel you are not wanted anywhere
. (Anywhere) 
. If you ever look behind
. And do not like what you find
. There is something you should know
. You have got a place to go
. (You have got a place to go) . 
. I used to say "I" and "me"
. Now it is "us", now it is "we"
. I used to say "I" and "me"
. Now it is "us", now it is "we". 
. Ben, most people would turn you away
. I do not listen to a word they say
. They do not see you as I do
. I wish they would try to
. I am sure they would think again
. If they had a friend like Ben 
. (A friend) 
. Like Ben
. (Like Ben) 
. Like Ben. 
. I took my love, I took it down. I climbed a mountain and I turned around. And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills. 'Till the landslide brought me down. Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?. Can the child within my heart rise above?. Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?. Can I handle the seasons of my life?. Well, I have been afraid of changing. Because I have built my life around you. But time makes you bolder. Even children get older. And I am getting older too. Well, I have been afraid of changing. Because I have built my life around you. But time makes you bolder. Even children get older. And I am getting older too. Oh, I am getting older too. Oh, take my love, take it down. Oh, climb a mountain and turn around. And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills. Well the landslide will bring it down. And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills. Well the landslide will bring it down, oh oh. The landslide will bring it down. 
. Well, I heard there was a secret chord. That David played and it pleased the Lord. But you do not really care for music, do you?. Well it goes like this:. The fourth, the fifth, the minor fall and the major lift. The baffled king composing Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.... Well your faith was strong but you needed proof. You saw her bathing on the roof. Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya. She tied you to her kitchen chair. She broke your throne and she cut your hair. And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.... Well, baby, I have been here before. I have seen this room and I have walked this floor (you know). I used to live alone before I knew ya. And I have seen your flag on the marble arch. And love is not a victory march. It is a cold and it is a broken Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.... Well, there was a time when you let me know. What is really going on below. But now you never show that to me, do ya?. But remember when I moved in you. And the holy dove was moving too. And every breath we drew was Hallelujah. Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah.... Maybe there is a God above. But all I have ever learned from love. Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya. And it is not a cry that you hear at night. It is not somebody who is seen the light. It is a cold and it is a broken Hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.... Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.... Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. Hallelujah, hallelujah.
