. I will sing it one last time for you. Then we really have to go. You have been the only thing that is right. In all I have done. And I can barely look at you. But every single time I do. I know we will make it anywhere. Away from here. Light up, light up. As if you have a choice. Even if you cannot hear my voice. I will be right beside you dear. Louder louder. And we will run for our lives. I can hardly speak I understand. Why you ca not raise your voice to say. To think I might not see those eyes. Makes it so hard not to cry. And as we say our long goodbye. I nearly do. Light up, light up. As if you have a choice. Even if you cannot hear my voice. I will be right beside you dear. Louder louder. And we will run for our lives. I can hardly speak I understand. Why you ca not raise your voice to say. Slower slower. We do not have time for that. All I want is to find an easy way. To get out of our little heads. Have heart, my dear. We are bound to be afraid. Even if it is just for a few days. Making up for all this mess. Light up, light up. As if you have a choice. Even if you cannot hear my voice. I will be right beside you dear.

. We can fight our desires. But when we start making fires. We get ever so hot. Whether we like it or not. They say we can love who we trust. But what is love without lust. Two hearts with accurate devotions. But what are feelings without emotions?. I am going in for the kill. I am doing it for a thrill. Oh, I am hoping you will understand. And not let go of my hand. I am going in for the kill. I am doing it for a thrill. Oh, I am hoping you will understand. And not let go of my hand. I hang my hopes out on the line. Well they will be ready for you in time. If you leave them out too long. They will be withered by the sun. Full stops and exclamation marks. My words stumble before I start. How far can you send emotions?. Can this bridge cross the ocean?. I am going in for the kill. I am doing it for a thrill. Oh, I am hoping you will understand. And not let go of my hand. I am going in for the kill. I am doing it for a thrill. Oh, I am hoping you will understand. And not let go of my hand. Let is go to war to make peace. Let is be cold to create heat. I hope in darkness we can see. And you are not blinded by the light from me. I am going in for the kill. I am doing it for a thrill. Oh, I am hoping you will understand. And not let go of my hand. I am going in for the kill. I am doing it for a thrill. Oh, I am hoping you will understand. And not let go of my hand.

I looked at you I knew you wanted to. Jump in the pool,. Jump in the pool.. I push off,. I breathe in,. The stillness turning away,. Do not look back,. Do not pretend,. We will never take control again.. And we are falling beyond the horizon,. And only the water remains. The fear is falling away.. On the poolside staring into glowing blue,. Swimsuit issues with my toes curled in the grooves,. I could tell that you wanted to,. Jump in the pool,. Jump in the pool,. I looked at you I knew you wanted to. Jump in the pool,.

The stillness turning away,. Do not look back,. Do not pretend,. We will never take control again.. And we are falling beyond the horizon,. And only the water remains. The fear is falling away.. 
. My brightest star is my inner light let it guide me. Experience and innocence bleed inside me. Hallucinogens can open me or untie me. I drift in inner space, free of time.
