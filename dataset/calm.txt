. Where are you going, with your long face pulling down?. Don’t hide away, like an ocean. But you can’t see, but you can smell. And the sound of waves crash down. I am no Superman. I have no reasons for you. I am no hero, oh that’s for sure. But I do know one thing. Is where you are, is where I belong. I do know, where you go is where I wanna be.

. Blue jean baby, L.A. lady, seamstress for the band. Pretty eyed, pirate smile, you will marry a music man. Ballerina, you must have seen her dancing in the sand. And now she is in me, always with me, tiny dancer in my hand. Jesus freaks out on the street. Handing tickets out for God. Turning back she just laughs. The boulevard is not that bad. Piano man he makes his stand. In the auditorium. Looking on she sings the songs. The words she knows the tune she hums. But oh how it feels so real. Lying here with no one near. Only you and you can hear me. When I say softly slowly. Hold me closer tiny dancer. Count the headlights on the highway. Lay me down in sheets of linen. You had a busy day today.

. I waited  notil I saw the sun. I do not know why I did not come. I left you by the house of fun. I do not know why I did not come. I do not know why I did not come. When I saw the break of day . I wished that I could fly away. Instead of kneeling in the sand. Catching teardrops in my hand. My heart is drenched in wine. But you will be on my mind. Forever. Out across the endless sea. I would die in ecstasy. But I will be a bag of bones. Driving down the road alone. My heart is drenched in wine. But you will be on my mind. Forever. Something has to make you run. I do not know why I did not come. I feel as empty as a drum. I do not know why I did not come. I do not know why I did not come. I do not know why I did not come. 
. We were born before the wind. Also younger than the sun. Ere the bonnie boat was won as we sailed into the mystic. Hark, now hear the sailors cry. Smell the sea and feel the sky. Let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic. And when that fog horn blows I will be coming home. And when the fog horn blows I want to hear it. I do not have to fear it. And I want to rock your gypsy soul. Just like way back in the days of old. And magnificently we will flow into the mystic. When that fog horn blows you know I will be coming home. And when that fog horn whistle blows I got to hear it. I do not have to fear it. And I want to rock your gypsy soul. Just like way back in the days of old. And together we will flow into the mystic. Come on girl.... Too late to stop now.... 
. Hearts are worn in these dark ages
. You are not alone in this story is pages
. The light has fallen amongst the living and the dying
. And I will try to hold it in, yeah I will try to hold it in. 
. The world is on fire and
. It is more than I can handle
. I will tap into the water
. (Try and bring my share)
. I try to bring more
. More than I can handle
. (Bring it to the table)
. Bring what I am able. 
. I watch the heavens but I find no calling
. Something I can do to change what is coming
. Stay close to me while the sky is falling
. Do not wanna be left alone, do not wanna be alone. 
. Hearts break, hearts mend
. Love still hurts
. Visions clash, planes crash
. Still there is talk of
. Saving souls, still the cold
. Is closing in on us. 
. We part the veil on our killer sun
. Stray from the straight line on this short run
. The more we take, the less we become
. The fortune of one that means less for some. . 
. Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
. Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
. Whatever colors you have in your mind
. I will show them to you and you will see them shine.. 
. Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
. Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
. Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
. His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
. And you are the best thing that he is ever seen.. 
. Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
. Why wait any longer for the world to begin
. You can have your cake and eat it too
. Why wait any longer for the one you love
. When he is standing in front of you..

. When your mind is a mess. So is mine. I ca not sleep. Because it hurts when I think. My thoughts are not at peace. With the plans that we make. Chances we take. They are not yours and not mine. There is waves that can break. All the words that we said. And the words that we mean. Words can fall short. Ca not see the unseen. Because the world is awake. For somebody is sake. Now, please close your eyes woman. Please get some sleep. And know that if I knew all of the answers. I would not hold them from.... You would know all of the things that I would know. We told each other, there is no other way. Well, too much silence can be misleading. You are drifting, I can hear it in the way that you are breathing. We do not really need to find reason. Because out the same door that it came. Well, it is leaving it is leaving. Leaving like a day that is done and part of a season. Resolve is just a concept that is as dead as the leaves. But at least we can sleep,. It is all that we need. When we wake we would find. Our minds will be free to go to sleep. And know that if I knew all the answers. I would not hold them from.... You would know all of the things that I would know. Because we told each other, there is no other way. 
. If I could tell the world just one thing
. It would be that we are all OK
. And not to worry because worry is wasteful
. And useless in times like these
. I wo not be made useless
. I wo not be idle with despair
. I will gather myself around my faith
. For light does the darkness most fear
. My hands are small, I know
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. And I am never broken
. Poverty stole your golden shoes
. It did not steal your laughter
. And heartache came to visit me
. But I knew it was not ever after
. We will fight, not out of spite
. For someone must stand up for what is right
. Because where there is a man who has no voice
. There ours shall go singing
. My hands are small I know
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. I am never broken
. In the end only kindness matters
. In the end only kindness matters
. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
. I will get down on my knees, and I will pray
. My hands are small I know
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. And I am never broken
. My hands are small I know
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. But they are not yours, they are my own
. And I am never broken
. We are never broken
. We are God is eyes
. God is hands
. God is mind
. We are God is eyes
. God is hands
. God is heart
. We are God is eyes
. God is hands
. God is eyes

. Still a little bit of your taste in my mouth. Still a little bit of you laced with my doubt. Still a little hard to say what is going on. Still a little bit of your ghost, your witness. Still a little bit of your face I have not kissed. You step a little closer each day. That I ca not say what is going on. Stones taught me to fly. Love ‒ it taught me to lie. Life ‒ it taught me to die. So it is not hard to fall. When you float like a cannonball. Still a little bit of your song in my ear. Still a little bit of your words I long to hear.

When you float like a cannon. Stones taught me to fly. Love taught me to cry. So come on, courage, teach me to be shy. Because it is not hard to fall. And I do not wanna scare her. It is not hard to fall. And I do not wanna lose. It is not hard to grow. When you know that you just do not know.

. I’m floating down a river. Oars freed from their holes long ago. Lying face up on the floor. Of my vessel. I marvel at the stars . And feel my heart overflow. Further down the river. Two weeks without my lover. I’m in this boat alone. Floating down a river named emotion. Will I make it back to shore?. Or drift into the unknown. Further down the river. I’m building an antenna. Transmissions will be sent. When I am through. Maybe we can meet again. Further down the river. And share what we both discovered. Then revel in the view. Further down the river. I’m floating down a river. 
. I took my love, I took it down. I climbed a mountain and I turned around. And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills. 'Till the landslide brought me down. Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?. Can the child within my heart rise above?. Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?. Can I handle the seasons of my life?. Well, I have been afraid of changing. Because I have built my life around you. But time makes you bolder. Even children get older. And I am getting older too. Well, I have been afraid of changing. Because I have built my life around you. But time makes you bolder. Even children get older. And I am getting older too. Oh, I am getting older too. Oh, take my love, take it down.
